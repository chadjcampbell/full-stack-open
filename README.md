# FullStackOpen Coursework

Welcome to my FullStackOpen-Coursework repository! This repository compiles coursework from the Full Stack Open online course, organized by part/exercise. Each part focuses on specific technologies and includes exercises, projects, and resources.

## Directories

Directories are set up by part, how the course suggests, with sub-directories for each exercise.

## Resources
